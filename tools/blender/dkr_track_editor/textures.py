"""Every texture a track can draw with: the ROM's 1401, and its own.

This module answers two questions that used to have much smaller answers.

**Which of the ROM's textures may a track use?** All of them. A track built
from a mesh borrowed a *donor* track's texture table and could draw with
nothing else - two or three dozen images - which was never a limit of the
format. The ROM holds **1401** in the US v1.0 extraction, a later revision a
few more, and a level model can name any of them.

**May a track bring artwork the ROM does not hold?** Now yes. A ``.dkrmap``
had no texture section, so for a while the honest answer was no and this
module's job stopped at browsing. It has one now, and the second half of the
file - from "Artwork the ROM does not hold" - is what fills it: an image
becomes a texture asset in the format ``load_texture`` reads, the runtime
publishes a longer ``ASSET_TEXTURES_3D`` table for it, and the id a level model
stores is rewritten as the model is served. The section comment there carries
the reasoning and the hardware limits.

That it can is not an assumption. ``TriangleBatchInfo.textureIndex`` selects
from the model's own table, and each 8-byte ``TextureInfo`` there is
``{id, width, height, format, surfaceType}`` where ``id`` indexes
``ASSET_TEXTURES_3D``. ``tracks.c`` resolves it with
``load_texture(id | 0x8000)`` at load time, from the same global list every
object model draws from - nothing scopes a texture to the track that shipped it.

**Three of those four bytes are never read by the game.** Grepping the decomp
for reads of a level model's texture table finds exactly two, both of
``surfaceType`` (``tracks.c`` and ``collision.c``); ``width``, ``height`` and
``format`` have no reader at all, because the renderer takes all three from the
``TextureHeader`` the asset itself carries. They are still written honestly
here, for two reasons: the addon's own UV maths divides by the size, and a file
that describes itself wrongly is a trap for the next person reading it.

So the values come from the asset, measured against what retail wrote:

* **Size** is the PNG's own. It matches the table in 1358 of the 1360 entries
  across all 55 retail level models. The two that differ - a wall in Darkmoon
  Caverns and a fog texture in Wizpig 2 - declare a size larger than the image,
  which stretches it; nothing here needs to reproduce that.
* **Format** is the sidecar's name through :data:`FORMAT_CODES`. The low nibble
  of retail's byte agrees with the sidecar's ``format`` in all 1360, over the
  five formats level geometry uses. The high nibble is 0x00, 0x10, 0x20 or 0x30
  and correlates with nothing in the asset - not the wrap flags, not the render
  mode, not the frame count - so it is left at zero rather than guessed at. It
  has no reader.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.

# Everything above browses the 1401 pictures already in the cartridge. This is
# the part that adds one, and the module docstring's opening claim - that a
# ``.dkrmap`` cannot - is the thing it retires.
#
# **Why it was true, and why it stopped being true.** Nothing in the *format*
# ever forbade it. A 3D texture is reached exactly the way a level header is:
#
#     gTextureAssetTable[TEX_TABLE_3D] = asset_table_load(ASSET_TEXTURES_3D_TABLE);
#     for (i = 0; table[i] != -1; i++) {}  // count, then i--
#     assetOffset = table[assetIndex];
#     assetSize   = table[assetIndex + 1] - assetOffset;   // size BY DIFFERENCE
#     asset_load(ASSET_TEXTURES_3D, dest, assetOffset, assetSize);
#
# That is ``tex_init_textures`` and ``load_texture`` in ``textures_sprites.c``,
# and it is the same shape DKR-R's custom tracks already grow: publish a longer
# table whose extra offsets begin at the retail end offset, and the count, the
# range check and the loader all follow. The limit was only that the runtime's
# section list had four entries and none of them was textures. It now has five,
# so what a track ships is no longer only geometry.
#
# **What a texture id in a level model means once a track can add one.** The
# index the runtime assigns is ``retail_count + ordinal``, and the retail count
# is a property of the ROM the player owns - measured at 1401 in the US v1.0
# extraction and 1416 in Rev A. The addon cannot know it and must not guess it,
# so it writes a *sentinel*
# instead (:data:`CUSTOM_ID_BASE` plus the ordinal) and the runtime rewrites it
# as the model is served, exactly as it already rewrites a header's model and
# object-map fields. See ``docs/CUSTOM_TRACKS.md``.
#
# **What the hardware fixes, and it is not negotiable.** The RDP has 4 KiB of
# texture memory and ``material_init`` loads a whole texture as one block, so
# 2048 texels is the ceiling for a 16-bit format - 64x32, not 64x64. And its
# mask loop only walks the powers of two up to 64, so a texture wider or taller
# than that clamps instead of tiling however its flags are set. Both are
# checked here rather than discovered as a corrupt road in game.

#: The texture id a track writes for its own first added texture, with the rest
#: following it. Any value works that no retail id can reach and that survives
#: ``load_texture``'s ``id & 0x7FFF``; 0x7000 is an order of magnitude above the
#: largest retail table and half the 15-bit space below the mask.
CUSTOM_ID_BASE = 0x7000

#: How many a track may add. A model's texture table is indexed by a ``u8`` with

#: flags say.

# **An invariant the high-resolution texture packs depend on.** The identity

# the renderer derives from the tile ``material_init`` sets up - its mask, its
# clamp bits and the DXT of the load - and not from the image's own size. The
# two agree for every texture :func:`check_size` accepts: a power of two no
# larger than MAX_WRAP_SIZE makes the mask exactly the side, and
# ``gDPLoadTextureBlock`` makes the tile exactly the image whichever wrap flags
# :func:`texture_header` writes. Loosen either rule and every pack already
# handed out stops matching, silently - the game draws the 64x32 and nothing
