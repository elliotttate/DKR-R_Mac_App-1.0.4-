"""Write the ``.dkrmap`` container DKR-R loads custom tracks from.

The layout and the rules are in docs/CUSTOM_TRACKS.md. A track is a directory
named ``*.dkrmap`` holding a manifest and one binary payload per asset-table
section, and DKR-R serves those bytes without ever parsing a level format.

**What this module produces.** The ``LEVEL_OBJECT_MAPS`` payload is written
here, by :mod:`object_map_encoder`, without the decomp's ``dkr_assets_tool`` -
that tool builds a whole ``assets.bin`` and ships as a Linux binary, so
depending on it would have put a C++ toolchain between an author and their
track. The encoder is checked against the retail bytes: it reproduces all 136
shipped object maps exactly.

``TEXTURES_3D`` is written here too, and it is the one section a track adds
**many** payloads to. Their order is their identity - the runtime numbers them
by position and the level model names them by the same position - so they are
written in ordinal order and never sorted.

The glTF sources go in beside the payloads, both as the input the asset tool
would take and as something an author can read.

A manifest never claims a payload that is not there: bytes promised and missing
fail at load time with a far more confusing error than the one reported here.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.
