"""Everything that depends on what kind of level a track is.

The *Level Type* is the first thing an author answers and the switch the rest of
the addon obeys: what can be placed, how many start positions a grid gets,
which checks validation runs and what the header's race type says. Keeping all
of it here, rather than scattered across the panels and operators that use it,
means one table decides it and the tests can reach it without Blender. See
LEVEL_TYPE_PLAN.md for where each number comes from.

Two words are used carefully. A **family** is what the first dropdown offers:
Race, Boss Race, Challenge, Hub, Special. A **key** is what the game can tell
apart - the family, except that Challenge and Special each split into three,
because race types 64, 65 and 66 behave differently and the Egg Creator only
works in one of them. Every retail ``race_type`` maps to exactly one key, so an
import round-trips the value it came with.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.
