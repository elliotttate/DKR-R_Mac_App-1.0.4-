"""Lay a level model out afresh, for edits that change how much of it there is.

Step 3 of Phase 2. Steps 1 and 2 kept every array at the offset it was read
from, which is what let an author reshape a track for free - no count changed,
so no offset moved. Adding or removing a triangle breaks that: everything after
it shifts, and the file has to be built rather than patched.

Two jobs live here, and they are separate on purpose.

:func:`rebatch_segment` turns a flat list of faces back into batches. A batch is
one draw call over a contiguous window of the segment's vertices, and the
windows partition the vertex array exactly - measured across all 2292 retail
segments, zero gaps and zero overlaps - so no vertex is shared between batches
and a re-batcher duplicates rather than shares. That is not an optimisation to
undo later; the triangle's vertex index is a ``u8`` counted from the batch's own
window, so a shared vertex is not expressible.

:func:`rebuild` assigns fresh offsets. Retail's own layout is not reproducible
by rule - the padding between arrays runs 0, 4, 8, 10, 12 ... 770 bytes with no
pattern - so this writes a *valid* layout rather than *the* layout, and the
section order it uses is retail's, which is universal across all 55 models:
header, textures, segments, then per segment batches, triangles and vertices,
then bounding boxes, the BSP, the PVS and the collision facet reservations.

Three things are measured rather than assumed, and the module docstrings say so
where it matters:

* ``modelSize`` at 0x48 is the inflated length. All 55 models.
* A batch terminator holds ``(vertex count, triangle count)``. All 1146
  segments.
* Which side of ``numberofOpaqueBatches`` a batch is on is **not** a free
  choice. No flag bit and no texture *format* separates the two sides, which is
  what this note used to conclude from; the texture's *render mode* does, as
  ``render_level_segment`` reads it. That rule, in :mod:`.transparency`, puts
  every textured retail batch on the side retail wrote. Here opacity still
  travels with the face - the caller derives it - and is never inferred.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.

    This is what a track grown outside its inherited segmentation needs. The
    three steps before it edit a segmentation; none of them makes one, so a
    shape extruded a long way stays in the segment it grew from and stretches

    candidate list and inherits visibility bits that say nothing about the new

    * ``hasWaves`` is **not** scratch. ``tracks.c`` tests it to decide whether a

      the right default for a new track and what every Ancient Lake segment
