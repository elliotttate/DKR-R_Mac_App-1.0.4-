"""What the race AI reads from a track, reproduced so an author can see it.

Two things decide how the computer racers drive a race: the checkpoints, which
they steer along, and a handful of level header bytes, which decide how fast and
how aggressive they are. Neither is visible in the data. This module turns both
into something a panel and a viewport overlay can show, and it reproduces the
game's own arithmetic rather than an approximation of it - a line that is almost
where the bots drive is worse than none.

**The line.** ``checkpoint_update_all`` (``objects.c``) keeps the checkpoints
whose ``vehicleType`` equals ``header.unk4F[vehicle]``, at most
:data:`MAX_CHECKPOINTS` of them, numbers an alternate-route gate ``index + 255``,
bubble-sorts on that, and pairs each alternate with the main gate of the same
``index``. ``func_80045C48`` (``racer.c``) then takes four consecutive gates,
moves each by the racer's lane -

    x += node.scale * cos(yaw) * lateral
    y += node.scale * vertical
    z -= node.scale * sin(yaw) * lateral

where ``node.scale = max(scale, 5) / 64 * 2`` - and steers along the
``cubic_spline_interpolation`` (a Catmull-Rom spline) through them. The lateral
direction is ``(cos yaw, 0, -sin yaw)`` because ``mtxf_transform_point`` treats
its matrix as row vectors: ``mtxf_from_transform`` with a Y rotation alone sends
``(0, 0, 1)`` to ``(sin yaw, 0, cos yaw)``, the gate's normal.

**The difficulty.** ``aitable_init`` (``game.c``) picks one of ten behaviour
tables from the header's ``ai-levels`` block, and ``func_80042D20`` reads each
racer's start skill out of ``unkC`` or ``unk16``. What each byte does is below,
next to the field it lives in.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``, like the other format modules, so it is tested on a
plain Python against every retail map.
