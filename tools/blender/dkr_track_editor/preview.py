"""Give a placed object the look it has in game.

An author placing a palm tree should see a palm tree. Before this, every object
was an Empty cross, so a track was a cloud of identical markers and there was no
way to tell a balloon from a checkpoint without clicking it.

Two representations, decided by the object's header:

* **sprite billboard** - an upright, texture-mapped quad. This is what most DKR
  scenery actually is: palm trees, balloons, coins and bushes are camera-facing
  2D sprites in the real game, not meshes, and they account for 84 of the 304
  object headers against 211 real models.
* **3D model** - a mesh built from the decoded ``ObjectModel``, with the baked
  vertex colours it ships with.

A type whose header points at a debug placeholder keeps the addon's own marker
instead, because an AI node is a marker rather than a thing and a row of
identical debug dots reads far worse than sized, distinct markers.

Every object keeps its decoded fields as custom properties and exports through
the same path either way: what the object map is made of is the transform and
the fields, never what the object is drawn with. ``tests/test_blender_roundtrip``
imports every retail map twice, once with artwork and once without, and requires
both to reproduce the file byte for byte.

Mesh data, materials and images are shared between every instance of a type, so
a map with two hundred trees holds one tree mesh.
