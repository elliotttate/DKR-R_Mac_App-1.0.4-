"""Move object maps between the file format and Blender's scene.

Every placed object becomes an Empty carrying its decoded fields as custom
properties. That choice is what keeps the round trip exact: Blender's
IDProperties store ints as ints and floats as floats, so nothing is coerced on
the way through, and anything the catalogue does not model is kept verbatim and
written straight back out.

Three details are worth knowing before changing anything here.

**Axes.** Object maps are Y-up, as glTF is; Blender is Z-up. The mapping is
``blender = (x, -z, y)``. A rotation about the map's +Y axis comes out as the
same rotation about Blender's +Z, with the same sign, which is what lets an
author rotate an object in the viewport and have ``angleY`` follow.

**Names.** Blender makes object names unique by appending ``.001``, but the
document needs the original. The exact node name is kept in ``dkr_node_name``
and the Blender name is only a label.

**Absent fields.** Some fields are optional and a retail map omits them. Writing
one back where retail had none would change the encoded entry, so the names that
were missing on import are remembered in ``dkr_absent`` and omitted again.
