"""The name RT64 replaces a track's own texture by, worked out before the game runs.

A texture pack in Rice's layout names each replacement image by an *identity*::

    <crc>#<fmt>#<siz>

RT64's patch ``patches/rt64/0011-enable-runtime-rice-texture-aliases.patch``
computes it from the texture's bytes in RDRAM and a handful of numbers it reads
off the tile descriptors the game set up. For a texture this addon wrote, every
one of those inputs is known offline: the bytes are the ones in
``textures/N.bin``, and the descriptors are what ``material_init`` builds from
the ``TextureHeader`` in front of them. So the identity can be computed here,
and a pack naming the author's full-resolution original under it has RT64 draw
that original where the game loaded 64x32.

It is safe for the reason a texture pack usually is not. A pack replaces by
hash, globally - but the texture this one replaces was invented by the addon
and exists nowhere else in the ROM, so replacing it globally reaches only the
track that shipped it. And it fails cleanly: an identity that does not match
simply finds no replacement, and the game draws the 64x32.

Two parts, both transcriptions, both held to their sources by
``tests/test_rice_identity.py``:

* :func:`rice_crc32` is the patch's ``riceCRC32``. Three things about it are
  easy to get wrong, and each gives a CRC that is plausible and wrong:

  1. It reads each four bytes with ``memcpy`` into a ``uint32_t`` - a
     **little-endian** word on every machine RT64 runs on. Hence
     ``int.from_bytes(..., "little")``.
  2. The arithmetic is ``uint32_t`` and wraps; every sum is masked.
  3. Rows are read **in memory order** - ``source`` only ever advances - and
     each row right to left in steps of four. What counts *down* is only the
     row number XORed in at the end of each row, so the image's first row is
     combined with ``y == height - 1``.

  And one thing about its *input*, which is not the payload's texels as
  written: the patch reads ``state->RDRAM``, and N64Recomp stores RDRAM with
  every 32-bit word byte-swapped on a little-endian host (the ``^ 3`` in
  ``MEM_B``). The game's texture load and DKR-R's asset-load hook both write
  through that, so the bytes ``riceCRC32`` walks are the texels with each four
  reversed. :func:`rice_identity` feeds :func:`rice_crc32` that swapped view
  via :func:`rice_word_order`; every HD-eligible texture has a 4-aligned row,
  so a whole-buffer word swap is exact.

* :func:`live_rectangle` is the patch's derivation of the ``width``,
  ``height`` and ``bytesPerRow`` the CRC runs over, for the ``Block`` load that
  ``material_init`` issues - fed with exactly what ``gDPLoadTextureBlock``
  (``PR/gbi.h``) and ``material_init`` (``textures_sprites.c``) put in the
  tiles. The rectangle does **not** come from the image's size. It comes from
  the tile mask, the clamp bits and the load's DXT, reversed by search. That it
  lands on the image's own size is a property of the sizes the addon accepts,
  and :func:`derive` checks it rather than assuming it.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.
