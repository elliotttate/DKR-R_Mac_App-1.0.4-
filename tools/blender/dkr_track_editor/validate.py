"""Pre-export checks on an object map.

These are the cheap checks that catch the failures which are confusing to
diagnose in game: an AI graph the racers cannot follow, a track with nowhere to
start, an exit pointing at a level that does not exist. Everything here runs on
an :class:`~dkr_track_editor.gltf_io.ObjectMap`, so it can be run over retail
maps as a sanity check on the rules themselves.

Severities are separated on purpose. An ``error`` means the map is structurally
wrong and the game will misbehave. A ``warning`` means something is unusual but
retail does it too - isolated AI nodes, for instance, appear 27 times in shipped
tracks, so refusing them would be wrong.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.
