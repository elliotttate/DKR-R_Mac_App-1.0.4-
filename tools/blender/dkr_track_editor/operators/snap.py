"""Where a click in the viewport puts a new object, and the marker showing it.

A click lands on the first piece of track under the mouse. With the viewport's
snapping on - the magnet in the header, or Ctrl held to flip it, as in any
Blender transform - it follows the snap elements chosen there instead: a
vertex, an edge, an edge's or a face's midpoint, or the grid. Face snapping is
the plain landing, so it changes nothing.

The marker is drawn while the mouse moves, so where the next click goes is on
screen before it happens: a click that would land somewhere unexpected is seen
and not made.
