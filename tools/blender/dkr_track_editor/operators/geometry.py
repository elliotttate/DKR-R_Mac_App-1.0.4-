"""Import track geometry as an editable mesh, and drop objects onto it.

The geometry used to be a read-only reference: something to aim at while
placing objects, decoded from the model the game ships and never written back.
It is now the thing being authored, which changes what the importer owes the
exporter.

**One vertex, one mesh entry.** An edit is addressed in the file as
``(segment, vertex index)``, so every Blender vertex has to say which file
vertex it is. The old importer built up to three meshes and gave each of them
*all* of a segment's vertices whenever any of that segment's batches matched -
so a segment holding both surface and decoration batches had its vertices in two
meshes at once, and "which copy did the author move" had no answer. Across the
110 retail models that duplicated 223,968 of 250,578 vertex slots. So there is
now a single mesh holding every vertex of every segment exactly once, in file
order, carrying its identity in two integer attributes:

* ``dkr_segment`` - index into ``model.segments``
* ``dkr_vertex`` - index into that segment's vertex list

Both are on the ``POINT`` domain, and :mod:`geometry_export` reads them back.
Segments that contribute no drawable face still get their vertices, because a
vertex with no face is still a vertex the file has and still has to be
addressable.

**The three-way split becomes material slots.** Surface, decoration and
invisible wall mean genuinely different things to an author, and 986 invisible
walls across the retail tracks depend on being findable. They are now per face
rather than per object: one material slot per (kind, texture), which is exactly
what Blender's own material-slot Select button already filters on, so the
distinction stays selectable without a second copy of the geometry. Solid
viewport shading draws the slot's ``diffuse_color``, tinted per kind, so solid
mode reads as the kind view and material preview as the texture view.

**Batch flags ride on the faces.** ``dkr_flags`` on the ``FACE`` domain carries
the whole ``u32`` its batch was drawn with, not just the two bits that name the
kind - a batch's other bits are real render state and re-deriving them from a
kind would throw them away. Because batch vertex windows partition a segment's
vertex array exactly (measured: no overlap and no gap in any of the 2292 retail
segments), a face's batch is recoverable from any one of its vertices, which is
what keeps the mapping exact even where Blender drops a face.

**What is deliberately not called is ``mesh.validate()``.** It silently removes
degenerate and duplicate faces, and retail has 8 of the former and 134 of the
latter. Dropping them without saying so is fine for a viewer and not fine for an
editor, so the degenerate and out-of-range ones are filtered here, counted, and
reported.

#: ships a header pointing at nothing.

ATTR_UV = "dkr_uv"

PROP_STEM = "dkr_stem"

#: The base model's texture table, and the entries the author has added on top
#: of it, both as JSON lists of ``{"id", "w", "h", "format", "surface"}``.
#:
#: A face names its texture by table index, so anything that hands an author a
#: texture the base model never had has to say what the new indices mean - and
#: has to say it on the object, because the base ``.bin`` is not reloaded until
#: the export. The base half is recorded so that picking a texture the track
#: already carries reuses its entry instead of appending a duplicate.
#:
#: An added entry also carries ``"anim"``, the frame count of the artwork, which
#: is what decides whether the model's animation gate has to be raised for it.
PROP_BASE_TEXTURES = "dkr_base_textures"

PROP_CATEGORY = "dkr_category"

#: Which entry of the model's texture table a material draws, and what the
#: ground made of it behaves like. The surface type is a byte on the *texture
#: table entry*, not on the triangle and not on the texture file - so two
#: entries can point at the same image and behave differently, which is how the
#: game gets one picture that is grass in one place and road in another. That is
#: why a material is keyed by table entry rather than by the PNG it shows:

PROP_TEXTURE_INDEX = "dkr_texture_index"

#: ``include/enums.h``; this is only the behaviour measured alongside them, and
#: a member with no entry simply has no tooltip. Kept apart on purpose: naming
#: the enum is format knowledge and belongs with the catalogue, while what grass
#: costs you is what an author is choosing between.
