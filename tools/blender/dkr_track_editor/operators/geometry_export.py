"""Turn the author's edits to the geometry mesh back into a level model.

There are two ways back, and which one runs is decided by what the author did
rather than chosen.

**Nothing was added or removed.** The original ``.bin`` is reloaded and only the
differences are applied to it, so every array, offset, pad byte and
uninitialised scratch region the encoder has to reproduce comes back untouched
for free. An import and immediate export reproduces the shipped model byte for
byte. This is the path a reshaped track takes, and it is why reshaping is cheap.

**Counts changed.** Then every offset after the change shifts and the file has
to be built rather than patched: each segment is rebatched from the mesh and
:func:`level_model_layout.rebuild` lays the blob out afresh. That path cannot be
byte-identical to retail and is not meant to be - retail's padding between
arrays runs 0, 4, 8, 10 ... 770 bytes with no pattern, so a rebuild writes a
*valid* layout rather than *the* layout. Keeping the two paths apart is what
stops an unedited track losing its byte equality just because the code can now
rebuild one.

WHAT THE MESH HAS TO CARRY, AND WHY IT IS WHAT IT IS

Blender propagates both point and face attributes through extrude, subdivide
and duplicate - measured, not assumed: a face extruded from one flagged
``0x7ABCDE`` comes out flagged ``0x7ABCDE``, and its vertices inherit the
identity of the vertices they were pulled from. That is the mechanism this
module rests on, and it has one consequence worth stating plainly, because it
is the opposite of what it looks like:

**A new vertex does not arrive as zero.** Only a vertex conjured from nothing
does. One made by extruding arrives carrying its source's identity, so the same
``(segment, vertex)`` pair legitimately appears twice. In step 2 that was a
collision to refuse; here it is simply how Blender says "this came from that".
So identity is read as *which segment a vertex belongs to* plus *where it sits
in the pool*, never as a unique key. The bias by one still earns its place: it
is what separates "conjured from nothing" from "vertex 0 of segment 0".

Everything a rebuilt segment needs is read raw off the mesh rather than
converted back - the UVs from ``dkr_uv``, the baked colours from the separate
``dkr_colour_r/g/b/a`` channels (or packed ``dkr_colour`` in older scenes)
- because the values an author sees are normalised, V-flipped and sRGB, and
none of those survive the trip back exactly. A segment nobody touched has to
come out unchanged, which rules out a lossy conversion anywhere near it.
