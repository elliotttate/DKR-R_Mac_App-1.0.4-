"""Draw a track with any texture the ROM holds, and map it so it reads.

Until now a custom track could only use the textures its base model happened to
ship with - a donor track's two or three dozen images, chosen once when the
mesh was converted and unchangeable afterwards. That was never a limit of the
format. A ``TextureInfo`` stores an index into the ROM's global 3D texture list
and ``tracks.c`` resolves it with ``load_texture(id | 0x8000)``, exactly as an
object model does; nothing scopes an id to the track that shipped it. So the
browser here offers **1401** of them, not 25.

The other ceiling - that a ``.dkrmap`` had no texture section, so the artwork
had to already be in the ROM - is gone too, and :mod:`custom_textures` is where
that lives. Nothing in this module knows the difference: a texture a track
brought presents the same handful of attributes a ROM one does, so it browses,
applies, maps and exports through everything below unchanged.

So this module does two things, and the second is what makes the first usable.

**Picking.** :mod:`..textures` resolves the whole list to browsable entries and
the panel shows them as thumbnails. Applying one appends an entry to the mesh's
record of the track's texture table if it does not already hold a matching one,
and points the selected faces at it.

**Mapping.** A texture with no UVs under it is a solid colour, so an operator
that only changed the index would look broken most of the time. Two mappings
are offered and both are exact:

* *Keep the current mapping* rescales the raw texel UVs by the ratio of the two
  texture sizes, which leaves the picture covering the same ground as the one
  it replaced. This is the swap-a-picture case.
* *Project flat* is for faces that have no usable mapping at all - a face built
  in Blender, or one extruded out of the track, whose UVs were interpolated
  from its source and are well-formed and geometrically meaningless. It plants
  the texture on the world at a fixed number of map units per repeat, along
  whichever axis the face most faces. The per-face offset it subtracts is a
  **whole number of repeats**, so neighbouring faces still line up: tiling
  stays continuous across the join instead of restarting at every triangle.

The default scale is retail's own. Measured over 257,035 textured triangle
edges across all 55 level models, one repeat covers a median of 268 map units,
with quartiles at 149 and 449; :data:`..textures.DEFAULT_PROJECTION_SCALE` is
256, the power of two inside that.

**Animation is not offered as a choice, because it is not one.**
``RENDER_TEX_ANIM`` says the batch's artwork has more than one frame, and retail
agrees with itself exactly: over all 10,389 batches in the 55 level models the
bit is set on the 619 whose texture is animated and on none of the 9,770 whose
texture is not. So applying an animated texture sets it and applying a still one
clears it. Waterfalls use a separate TexScroll object, authored by
:mod:`.waterfall`; their movement does not depend on this frame-animation bit.

**Transparency is partly a choice, and the rest follows from it.** Which pass
the game draws a face in is the texture's to decide, so applying a see-through
texture moves the faces to the see-through side of ``numberofOpaqueBatches``
and a solid one moves them back - left where they were, a road retextured with
the ROM's water was never drawn at all. What the author does choose is whether
the alpha cuts holes or blends, which is ``RENDER_CUTOUT`` on the faces. See
:mod:`..transparency`.
