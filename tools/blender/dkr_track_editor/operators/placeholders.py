"""Buttons for what the sidebar shows but the addon cannot do yet.

Drawn as real buttons, greyed out, rather than left out: the layout is the one
the finished feature will have, and a disabled button's tooltip says why it is
disabled, which a missing one cannot. Each ``poll`` is false and says so.
