"""Turn a mesh an author modelled into track geometry.

The three steps of Phase 2 all start from a track the game already ships. This
is the one that does not: a mesh built in Blender, with no segmentation, no
texture table and no identity on any vertex, becoming a level model.

**How it works, and why in that order.** The mesh is read into loose faces and
one vertex pool, exactly the shape :func:`level_model_layout.rebatch_segment`
takes. :func:`level_model_layout.blank_model` supplies a model with every field
of the segment struct that is not safe to leave at zero already set - which is
why nothing here names one. The faces go into its single segment, and then
:func:`level_model_layout.resegment` partitions the whole thing properly and
builds the bounding boxes, the BSP and the PVS to match.

The result is written out as a ``.bin`` and then imported back through the
ordinary path, rather than being turned into a mesh directly. That is not a
detour: the author gets the same editable geometry as any other track, with the
identity attributes, the material slots and the base file that every other
operator here already understands, and there is exactly one importer to keep
correct instead of two.

**Where the textures come from.** Three places, and a conversion can use more
than one:

* **The mesh's own materials.** A mesh an author textured in Blender carries
  its pictures on its materials, and :func:`_adopt_images` makes each of them
  one of the track's own textures - resampled to what the RDP can load, with
  the original kept for the export's high-resolution pack. This is the flow
  the whole feature exists for: model, ``Ctrl+J``, *Track From Mesh*, export,
  and the track draws what the author drew. It happens here, before any
  triangulating, because this is the one moment a polygon and its material
  and its UVs are all still in hand - ``apply_material_textures.py`` has to
  match faces back by position precisely because it runs after that moment.
* **A donor track's table**, for :class:`DKR_OT_track_from_mesh`: a coherent
  set of the ROM's images with their surface types, and whatever a material
  that came off an imported track already names.
* **Nothing**, for a material with no picture. Its faces come out untextured,
  and the Textures panel - where all 1401 of the ROM's textures are available
  rather than one track's table - is where they get their look.
