"""Bring a picture into a track as artwork the ROM never had.

:mod:`..textures` holds the whole of the *format* side of this - what a
``TextureHeader`` is, what fits texture memory, what id a level model stores for
a texture its package ships. None of it needs Blender and all of it is tested
without one. This module is the other half: getting an author's JPEG or PNG,
whatever size and shape it is, down to something that side will accept.

**Resampling is the work, and it is brutal.** A level texture is loaded into the
RDP's 4 KiB of texture memory as a single block, so a colour image gets 2048
texels - 64x32. A 2752x1536 photograph is 4.2 million. There is no version of
this that keeps the picture *in the track*; the honest thing is to do the
reduction plainly, say what it did, and put the result in front of the author as
a thumbnail before they build a track around it.

**Why the PNGs beside the .blend rather than the file the author picked.** The
package has to be rebuildable from the ``.blend``, and the picked file might be
a JPEG on a drive that is not there any more. So the import writes what it
resampled, as a PNG, in a folder beside the scene, and everything afterwards -
the thumbnail, the material, the export - reads that.

It also writes the picture **at full resolution**, as a PNG in ``original/``
under that folder. The track never reads it. The export's high-resolution
texture pack does: RT64 draws it in place of the 64x32, which gets back what
the reduction threw away - see :mod:`..rice_pack`. Keeping it beside the scene
is what lets that pack be rebuilt from the ``.blend`` too.

**One way in, used twice.** :func:`add_image` is the whole import - resample,
check through the encoder, keep the original, record it. The Add Custom Texture
button calls it with a file the author picked; *Track From Mesh* calls it with
each image the mesh's materials draw. There is no second copy to drift.

**Ordinals are positions and positions are identity.** The runtime hands a
track's textures ids by their order in its manifest, and the level model names
them by the same order. So adding goes on the end, and removing has to move
every id behind it down one - which the mesh records, not the scene, so the two
are stepped together here.

That is also why removing stops short of a texture the geometry has already
taken a *table entry* for. A table index is a position too, and dropping an
entry would move every later one along with the faces that hold it, the
materials keyed by it and the surface types read off those materials. No other
operator in the addon removes a table entry - clearing a texture off faces
leaves the entry standing - so this one does not invent that either. It says
which mesh is holding on and what to do about it.
