"""What makes the game draw a face see-through, and how an author asks for it.

Three things decide it, and only one of them is the face's own.

**The texture's render mode.** ``material_init`` (``textures_sprites.c``) reads
the high nibble of ``TextureHeader.format`` and gives the texture
``RENDER_SEMI_TRANSPARENT`` when it says ``TRANSPARENT`` or ``TRANSPARENT_2`` -
for RGBA32, RGBA16 and CI4. The three greyscale-with-alpha formats (IA16, IA8,
IA4) get it whatever the nibble says, and the two plain greyscale ones (I8, I4)
never do. The flag is then OR-ed into the batch's own when it is drawn, which
turns the render mode into ``G_RM_AA_ZB_XLU_SURF``: blended by the texel's
alpha, and not writing depth.

**Which pass draws the batch.** ``render_level_segment`` (``tracks.c``) is
called twice per segment: once for batches ``[0, numberofOpaqueBatches)`` and
once for ``[numberofOpaqueBatches, numberOfBatches)``. Inside each run it draws
a batch only if the batch belongs to that pass, which is::

    opaque pass  <=>  (texture not SEMI_TRANSPARENT and batch not WATER)
                      or batch is DECAL

So a batch on the wrong side of the split is **never drawn at all** - skipped by
the pass it sits in, and outside the range of the pass it belongs to. This is
what made a transparent picture vanish from a custom track: the addon kept the
side a face came from, and a road retextured with the ROM's water stayed on the
opaque side, where the game will not draw water. The rule is not a guess:
across all 10,389 retail batches it puts 10,388 on the side retail wrote. The
one exception is an untextured, unflagged batch in ``volcano_track.bin`` that
the game never draws either, which is why :func:`draws_in_opaque_pass` is only
applied to textured faces.

**``RENDER_CUTOUT`` on the batch** (bit 4). ``material_set`` sends such a batch
through ``dRenderSettingsCutout``, whose z-buffered entries are all
``G_RM_AA_ZB_TEX_EDGE``: the texel's alpha cuts holes, the rest is solid and
writes depth, whatever the texture's render mode is. That is a fence, a leaf,
a grate. Retail sets it on 302 batches, every one of them over a transparent
texture, so the batch is drawn in the second pass; nothing breaks if the
texture is opaque instead, it is just drawn in the first.

So an author has three looks to choose from, and :data:`MODES` names them:

* ``OPAQUE`` - alpha is ignored. The texture is written ``OPAQUE``.
* ``CUTOUT`` - alpha cuts holes. The texture is written ``TRANSPARENT`` and the
  faces carry ``RENDER_CUTOUT``, as retail does.
* ``BLEND``  - alpha blends, glass or water. The texture is written
  ``TRANSPARENT`` and the faces do not carry ``RENDER_CUTOUT``.

For a texture of the track's own, the mode belongs to the texture - its render
mode is a byte of the texture - and the faces follow. For one of the ROM's the
render mode is fixed, so only the cut-out bit is left to choose.

**The pixels have to agree with the mode.** RGBA16 and IA4 keep one bit of
alpha, and the encoder writes it the way ``rgba2raw`` does: any alpha above zero
is opaque. A picture resampled by Blender has soft edges, so a cut-out written
straight would grow a fringe of texels that were meant to be holes - and whose
colour, in most exported PNGs, is black. :func:`prepare` hardens the alpha at
half and spreads each edge's colour into the holes beside it, so bilinear
filtering on the console and in RT64 blends into the right colour. It changes
the pixels the encoder reads and nothing about the encoder, which stays
byte-for-byte the asset tool's.

**Vertex alpha is a fourth path, and the loader owns it.** ``track_init_level_model``
turns a vertex coloured ``(1, 1, b, a)`` into grey with alpha ``b`` and flags its
batch ``RENDER_VTX_ALPHA``. Nothing here writes that; it is noted so nobody
paints a vertex that colour by accident and wonders why it faded.

Deliberately free of ``bpy``.
