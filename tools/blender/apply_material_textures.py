"""Turn a mesh's material images into the track's DKR textures.

The case this covers: you have a textured mesh - materials with image nodes, a
UV map - and DKR track geometry whose texture table knows nothing about any of
it. This takes each image down to something the RDP can hold, adds it to the
track's own artwork, gives it a texture table entry, and points the faces at it
with the UVs *you already made*.

**Two shapes of that, and the script does both.**

*One object.* The DKR geometry carries the materials itself. Each material slot
is a group of faces, and its image becomes one table entry.

*Two objects, same space.* A textured donor beside the DKR geometry - what you
get when a scene is imported and then converted. The conversion triangulates
and re-splits, so face 7 of one is not face 7 of the other and nothing can be
matched by index. Matched by position instead: the donor face under each DKR
face's **centroid**, and then the UV of each corner interpolated inside *that*
face. Centroid first is the whole trick - a corner sits on a shared edge, where
the nearest donor face is a coin toss and the two sides of a UV seam disagree
completely, while a centroid is unambiguously inside one face.

**The mapping is the point.** The addon's Apply Texture offers "keep the
mapping" (rescale the texel UVs a face already had) and "project flat" (plant
it on the world); neither can carry an unwrap over. So this converts the UV
directly to the file's fixed point - ``raw = u * 32 * width`` with V flipped,
the exact inverse of what the importer does - and an unwrap survives intact.

Everything heavy is the addon's: the resampler, the PNG decoder, the texel
encoder, ``allocate``. This only decides *what* to feed them.

Run it from Blender's Text Editor with the track geometry selected, or:

    blender scene.blend --python tools/blender/apply_material_textures.py

Save the .blend first. Resampled PNGs are written beside it, and an unsaved
scene has nowhere to put them that survives the session.
