"""Generate the level-header defaults a from-scratch track starts from.

A remix inherits its header from the track it reworks. A track with no ancestor
has nothing to inherit, and something has to decide what its 200 bytes hold.
This derives that from the 65 retail headers rather than inventing it:

* a field with the same value in all 65 is **fixed** — nobody chooses it
* a field that varies but has a dominant value is **defaulted** to that value
* a field with no dominant value is an **author choice**, and is left out of the
  defaults entirely so `level_header_template` has to be given one

Run it when the decomp assets move; the output is committed so the addon does
not need an extracted asset tree to write a header.

    python tools/blender/generate_header_defaults.py

The threshold for "dominant" is deliberately high. A value that only 20 of 65
tracks share is not a default, it is the most common of several real choices,
and picking it silently would give every from-scratch track the same world and
race type without ever saying so.
