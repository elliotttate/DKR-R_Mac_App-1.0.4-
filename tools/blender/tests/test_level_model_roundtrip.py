"""Round-trip gate for the level model reader and writer.

Phase 2 step 1 of docs/BLENDER_ADDON_PLAN.md: read every retail level model,
push it through the in-memory representation the addon will edit, write it back
and require the bytes to be identical. Nothing built on top of the geometry
encoder is trustworthy until this holds - a single field the decoder quietly
dropped becomes a track the game misreads.

This mirrors tests/test_roundtrip.py, which does the same for object maps, and
it is possible for the same reason: the correct bytes already exist in the
extracted assets, so the encoder can be proved rather than argued.

Two extra checks ride along, because byte equality alone can be reached by a
decoder that understands nothing and copies everything:

* **Coverage.** Bytes no decoded structure claimed are counted. They are real
  alignment padding in retail, so the budget is small; a regression that drops
  a whole array would blow through it rather than passing as padding.
* **The PVS size rule.** ``segmentsBitfields`` should be one visibility bitmask
  per segment. Checking that against every model is what turns it from a
  plausible reading of the layout into a verified one.

Run with any Python 3.8+; it does not need Blender.
