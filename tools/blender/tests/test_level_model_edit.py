"""Gate for the geometry edit path: derived values, and edits that survive.

Phase 2 step 2 of docs/BLENDER_ADDON_PLAN.md. Two things have to hold before an
author can reshape a track.

**The derivation rules are right.** ``recompute_bounds`` is run over every
extracted retail model without changing a single vertex, and must report nothing
to change. That is a strong claim rather than a tautology: the bounding box and
header bound values already in the file were produced by Rare's tools, so
reproducing all of them from the vertices alone - 1146 segments, including the
138 flat ones that need the zero-height guard - is what says the rule is the
rule. Get it wrong and the re-encode stops being byte-exact, which the second
half of each case checks.

**An edit goes in and comes back out.** A model is edited, encoded, decoded
again, and has to carry exactly the edit that was made and nothing else.

Run with any Python 3.8+; it does not need Blender.
