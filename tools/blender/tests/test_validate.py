"""Sanity-check the validation rules against retail tracks.

A rule that rejects a shipped Diddy Kong Racing track is a wrong rule, not a
finding. This runs the validator over every extracted retail object map and
reports what it flags, so the rules can be judged against data that is known
good by definition.

Retail maps cover hubs, cutscenes and challenge levels as well as races, so the
race-specific checks are only applied to maps that actually look like races.
