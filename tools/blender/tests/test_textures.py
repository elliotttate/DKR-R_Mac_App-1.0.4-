"""Gate for giving a custom track any texture the ROM holds.

A level model's texture table names entries of ``ASSET_TEXTURES_3D``, so a track
is not limited to the images its base model shipped with. Acting on that means
writing table entries the addon composed rather than ones it decoded, and this
is what says those entries are the ones retail would have written.

Four things have to hold, and each is checked against the whole retail set
rather than against an example.

**The catalogue describes retail's own table.** Every texture entry in every
level model is looked up in the catalogue built from the extracted assets, and
its size and format must be what retail put in the table. 1360 entries, and the
two known disagreements are named rather than tolerated silently.

**An added texture survives the file.** A model is given a texture, laid out,
encoded, decoded again, and has to come back with exactly that entry and nothing
else disturbed.

**The layout is rebuilt, not patched.** The texture table is the first array
after the header, so an extra entry runs into the segment array rather than off
the end of the blob - which no bounds check would catch. Growing the table has
to make an in-place encode refuse.

**Animation is a fact about the artwork, not a choice.** ``RENDER_TEX_ANIM`` is
set on a batch exactly when its texture has more than one frame, across all
10,389 retail batches. The addon sets the bit from the catalogue, so if that
correlation were not perfect the rule would be wrong.

Run with any Python 3.8+; it does not need Blender.
