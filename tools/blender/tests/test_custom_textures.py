"""Gate for a track shipping artwork the ROM does not hold.

The neighbouring suite checks that a track can name any of the ROM's 1401
textures. This one checks the step past that: an image the author brings
becoming an ``ASSET_TEXTURES_3D`` payload the game can load. Nothing here needs
an extraction or a ROM, so unlike its neighbour it always runs.

What it holds, and why each one is the thing that would break first.

**The bytes are the asset tool's.** ``dkr_assets_tool``'s
``BuildTexture::build`` writes a 32-byte ``TextureHeader`` and then the image,
and every field's value is reproduced here from that source rather than from a
sample - width, height, the render mode in the high nibble of ``format``,
``numberOfInstances``, the wrap flags, ``numOfTextures`` as a *byte* at 0x12,
and ``textureSize`` as the 16-byte-aligned total. Getting 0x12 wrong is
invisible until the game reads ``numOfTextures >> 8`` and allocates space for
zero display lists.

**The texel conversions are n64graphics'.** ``rgba2raw``, ``i2raw`` and
``ia2raw`` are small and exact, including the rounding: RGBA16 is
``((v + 4) * 31) / 255`` a channel and one bit of alpha, and an intensity is
``(r + g + b + 1) / 3``. A conversion that is merely close produces a texture
that looks right and does not match what the same PNG produces through the
decomp, which is the only reference either has.

**The size limits are the hardware's.** The RDP has 4 KiB of texture memory and
``material_init`` loads a level texture as one block, so a 16-bit format stops
at 2048 texels; and its mask loop only walks powers of two up to 64, so a
larger side clamps rather than tiles however the flags are set. Both are
refusals rather than warnings, because both produce a track that looks broken
in a way that does not point at its cause.

**The PNG reader reads PNGs.** All five colour types, both byte depths and all
five scanline filters, checked by decoding images built here with each.
