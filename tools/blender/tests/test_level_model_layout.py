"""Gate for the layout builder: adding and removing geometry.

Phase 2 step 3 of docs/BLENDER_ADDON_PLAN.md. Steps 1 and 2 kept every array
where it was found, which is what made them cheap and safe. This is the step
that gives that up, so it needs its own gate.

Retail's own layout is not reproducible by rule - the padding between arrays
runs 0, 4, 8, 10, 12 and on to 770 bytes with no pattern - so "rebuild and
compare to the file" is not available here the way it was for step 1. What is
available is stronger than it sounds:

* **The re-batcher is the identity on untouched data.** Pulling a segment apart
  into loose faces and putting it back must give the same batches, the same
  vertex order and the same triangles - not merely an equivalent segment. All
  2292 retail segments, both revisions. That is what says the decomposition
  loses nothing, and it is only true because a face remembers which batch it
  came from; grouping on the rendering fields alone merges the 411 segments
  that hold two batches agreeing on all of them.
* **A rebuilt layout round trips its content.** Rebuild, encode, decode, and
  every value has to come back - vertices, colours, triangles, UVs, batches,
  boxes, the BSP and the PVS. Only the offsets are allowed to differ.
* **The window invariant is a postcondition.** The Blender importer resolves a
  face to its batch through the batch windows, so a gap or an overlap
  mis-assigns render flags with nothing raised. Checked on retail and on
  everything this module builds.

The four retail models holding a degenerate triangle go through this path
untouched, because nothing here involves Blender - which is the point of
gating the encoder separately from the addon.

Run with any Python 3.8+; it does not need Blender.
