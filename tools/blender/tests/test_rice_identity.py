"""Gate for the high-resolution texture pack: the names in it are RT64's.

A pack entry only works if its name is the identity RT64 computes, live, for
the 64x32 the track ships - and a wrong name does not fail, it just finds no
replacement. So everything here is about the name being *exactly* right, from
two directions.

**The arithmetic is the patch's.** ``riceCRC32`` and ``reverseDXT`` are
extracted from ``patches/rt64/0011-enable-runtime-rice-texture-aliases.patch``
as the text of the patch itself, compiled, and run against the Python
transcription over thousands of pseudo-random buffers of every size and stride.
The same harness compiles DKR-R's own ``rice_texture_pack_policy.hpp`` and asks
its ``parse_filename`` to read back every name the pack writes. That needs a C++
compiler - ``DKR_CXX``, or ``g++``/``clang++``/``c++`` on the path - and is
reported as skipped without one. The known answers below were produced by the
compiled patch and keep the transcription honest either way.

**The rectangle is the renderer's.** The CRC runs over a width, height and row
stride the patch derives from the tiles ``material_init`` sets up - mask, clamp
bits, the DXT reversed by search - not from the image. Every size and format a
custom texture may take is pushed through that derivation, with every
combination of wrap flags, and it must land on the image's own size: that is
the invariant ``textures.py`` declares beside ``MAX_WRAP_SIZE``. The ones it
cannot land on - rows narrower than a word of texture memory - must be refused
with the reason, because their identity would be a hash of memory the addon
never wrote.
