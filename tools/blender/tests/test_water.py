"""Gate for water that moves: the wave grid, as the game builds it.

**The simulation of the game's grid is the game's.** ``func_800BBF78`` places
every segment on a grid sized by the reference water; :func:`water.simulate`
transcribes it, and every retail wave track has to come back the way it ships:
one segment per wave tile, nothing else on one, a single reference, and
nothing :func:`water.problems` objects to - except ``ocean_track.bin``, which
no header loads and which really is broken.

**Cutting a track into the grid keeps the track.** Every retail wave track is
cut again, and has to come out valid, keep its wave tiles where they were, keep
every triangle's ground covered, and survive the file.

**Water laid from nothing works.** A synthetic track with a pit gets waves over
the pit and nowhere else, one tile a segment, with a reference sized exactly
like a tile.

**The presets are retail's.** Each is compared with the header it was read out
of.

Run with any Python 3.8+; it does not need Blender.
