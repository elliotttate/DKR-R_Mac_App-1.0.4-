"""Round-trip retail object maps through an actual Blender scene.

tests/test_roundtrip.py proves the reader and writer agree. This proves the part
that plan step 1 actually cares about: that a map survives becoming Blender
objects and coming back. It is where a coerced integer or a lost field would
show up, since IDProperties, the transform stack and float precision are all in
the path.

Run it with Blender, not with a plain Python:

    blender --background --python tools/blender/tests/test_blender_roundtrip.py

Exits non-zero if any map fails to reproduce byte for byte.
