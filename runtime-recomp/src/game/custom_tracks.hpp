// Project-owned custom track support.
//
// DKR reaches every level through one indirection that is entirely data
// driven, so added tracks need no instruction patching:
//
//   gTempAssetTable = asset_table_load(ASSET_LEVEL_HEADERS_TABLE);
//   for (i = 0; gTempAssetTable[i] != -1; i++) {}   // count, then i--
//   if (levelId >= i) { /* retail range check, derived from the table */ }
//   offset = gTempAssetTable[levelId];
//   size   = gTempAssetTable[levelId + 1] - offset; // size BY DIFFERENCE
//   asset_load(ASSET_LEVEL_HEADERS, dest, offset, size);
//
// Two consequences drive this module:
//
//   * Publishing a longer table before the -1 terminator grows the level
//     count, the retail range check and gGlobalLevelTable together. A header
//     whose `world` field exceeds the retail maximum also grows
//     gNumberOfWorlds, because level_global_init derives it as a running max.
//
//   * Because size comes from the difference between consecutive entries, a
//     custom offset cannot be an arbitrary token: overwriting the retail end
//     offset would corrupt the size of the LAST retail entry. Custom offsets
//     therefore begin exactly AT the retail end offset and advance by exact
//     entry sizes, so the payload behaves as though appended to the section:
//
//       retail : [o0, o1, ..., o(n-1), oEnd, -1]                 -> n entries
//       result : [o0, o1, ..., o(n-1), oEnd, oEnd+s0, ..., E, -1] -> n+K
//
//     Retail arithmetic is untouched (o(n-1)'s size is still oEnd - o(n-1)),
//     custom entry j sits at table index n+j, and `offset >= oEnd` is the
//     discriminator that routes a load to a mod payload instead of the ROM.
namespace dkr::runtime::custom_tracks {

// Sections a custom track can contribute to. Each has a parallel `_TABLE`
// section in DKR's asset LUT; the table is what this module rewrites.
//
// Textures3D is the one that is not a level aspect, and it earns its place by
// being reached through exactly the same arithmetic. `tex_init_textures` and
// `load_texture` in textures_sprites.c:
//
//   gTextureAssetTable[TEX_TABLE_3D] = asset_table_load(ASSET_TEXTURES_3D_TABLE);
//   for (i = 0; table[i] != -1; i++) {}   // count, then i--
//   if (assetIndex >= gTextureTableSize[..]) { /* range check from the table */ }
//   assetOffset = table[assetIndex];
//   assetSize   = table[assetIndex + 1] - assetOffset;   // size BY DIFFERENCE
//   asset_load(ASSET_TEXTURES_3D, dest, assetOffset, assetSize);
//
// So a longer table grows the texture count and the range check together, and
// an appended payload loads, with no new mechanism at all. What it adds is that
// a track can ship artwork rather than only pick from the ROM's 1401 images.
//
// Two things are different in kind from the four above, and both are here
// rather than in the .cpp because they constrain callers:
//
//   * A track contributes MANY texture entries, not one, and their order in its
//     manifest is their identity. A level model refers to them by that order
//     through kCustomTextureIdBase below, and build_extended_table substitutes
//     the real indices into the model payload as it assembles it.
//   * The texture table is loaded ONCE, at boot, from thread3_main. The level
//     tables are rebuilt per load, so a rescan can renumber them; this one
//     cannot be renumbered after the fact, so a track discovered later has no
//     textures in the published table at all. Its model's ids are reset to
//     texture 0 rather than left pointing past the end of the table.
