# Third-party software and assets

DKR-R project code is distributed under `LICENSE.md`. A runtime linked with
N64ModernRuntime must also satisfy GPL-3.0; see
`runtime-recomp/COPYING-NOTICE.md`.

## Build and runtime components

| Project | Purpose | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| DavidSM64/Diddy-Kong-Racing | Matching source, ELF symbols and structures | See upstream `LICENSE.md` |
| N64Recomp | Static CPU and RSP translation | MIT |
| N64ModernRuntime | libultra-compatible host services | GPL-3.0 |
| RT64 | RDP rendering and presentation | MIT |
| GekkoNet | Pinned rollback research foundation; DKR-R currently uses its certified deterministic input-delay path while native host-stack rewind remains fail-closed | BSD-2-Clause |
| Monocypher | Authenticated encryption for online multiplayer datagrams | BSD-2-Clause or CC0 (DKR-R uses BSD-2-Clause) |
| libdatachannel | Optional WebRTC data channels and WebSocket signaling for five-character Quick Join | MPL-2.0 |
| Mbed TLS | Static TLS/DTLS provider used by Quick Join | Apache-2.0 or GPL-2.0-or-later (DKR-R uses Apache-2.0) |
| libjuice | ICE/STUN peer-route establishment used by libdatachannel | MPL-2.0 |
| usrsctp | SCTP data-channel transport used by libdatachannel | BSD-3-Clause |
| nlohmann/json | Signaling message encoding used by Quick Join | MIT |
| plog | Logging dependency used internally by libdatachannel | MPL-2.0 |
| SDL2 | Window, audio, input and controllers | Zlib |
| SDL3 | Private headless controller and Steam Deck sensor helper | Zlib |
| SDL_GameControllerDB | Community controller mappings loaded before user mappings | Zlib |
| Dear ImGui | Launcher and in-game settings UI | MIT |
| DirectX Shader Compiler | Windows shader compilation | University of Illinois/NCSA and bundled notices |

Exact dependency commits are recorded in `dependencies.lock.json`. Windows
packages include applicable notices in `ThirdPartyLicenses`. Linux AppImages
include project notices plus the copyright records and common licences for each
deployed system library under `usr/share/doc/dkr-port`.

The complete GekkoNet licence is distributed as `GEKKONET-LICENSE.txt`.
The complete Monocypher licence is distributed as `MONOCYPHER-LICENSE.txt`.
Quick Join packages also distribute the complete libdatachannel, Mbed TLS,
libjuice, usrsctp, nlohmann/json and plog licence texts. The public PeerJS
rendezvous carries signaling metadata only; DKR-R gameplay, controller input
and synchronized save data remain on the authenticated peer connection.

The controller mapping snapshot is documented in `assets/controllers/README.md`.
Its Zlib licence is distributed as `SDL-GAMECONTROLLERDB-LICENSE.txt`. Locally
created or imported mappings are stored in the user's DKR-R configuration
directory and are never written into the installed database.

## Fonts

Racing Banana is the launcher body font supplied by the project owner. It is not
extracted from Diddy Kong Racing. Its supplied source SHA-256 is
`AEADA6E5FF1388D27CC5D29DE9C67B74C0F6D851D6C772EE35376AF4E288C896`.
Public distributors are responsible for confirming redistribution permission.

Jumpman by Neale Davidson / Pixel Sagas is used for headings and the performance
overlay. Its supplied licence is packaged as `Jumpman-LICENSE.txt`; source
SHA-256 is
`36D473DF3E85F93AEECB619EF06432F4F6DCC572773AAB668D09C8AD9A04C334`.

Selawik by Microsoft Corporation (<https://github.com/microsoft/Selawik>,
release 1.01) is the embedded reading face of the MODS / HACKS page. It is an
open-source, metric-compatible stand-in for Segoe UI, licensed under the SIL
Open Font License 1.1, packaged as `Selawik-OFL.txt`. The Regular and Semibold
TTF sources have SHA-256
`E9D98518D8AC2817782A9A382430463A2E0793EA68350B695BB727D9A830EE1C` and
`0A9E9D0549A10F24BEF9B3A29E06FE6E0B5C21E7A784C503B048A307841A7783`.
Segoe UI itself is never bundled: on Windows the launcher reads the copy the
operating system installed, and uses Selawik when it is absent.

## CRT masks

Six optional PNG display masks are included for Modern presentation. They are
not game assets. Provenance, hashes and redistribution notes are in
`assets/filters/README.md` and `packaging/licenses/CRT-FILTERS-NOTICE.md`.

## Legacy mod importer dependencies

The separate legacy importer uses xdelta 3.2.0 (Apache-2.0), pinned at
`ff322e592383227b0d65ddfde7e0e5bbc504dc15`, and liblzma from XZ Utils 5.8.1
(0BSD). Sources and archive hashes are pinned in `runtime-recomp/cmake/LegacyMods.cmake`.
Only the decoding library is used; no external decompression commands or
user-supplied executable code are run. The private worker has resource and
cancellation limits, not a complete OS security sandbox. Compression/ZIP and
hashing reuse the existing miniz and Mbed TLS implementations. Notices are in
`LEGACY-MODS-NOTICE.txt` in both packages. No game or mod assets are bundled.

## Golden Balloon HUD reference

Golden Balloon (<https://github.com/akratch/goldenballoon>), revision
`83a847ccbd3e6334c9cc9c697122d5b3cddb91c1`, informed the one/two-player HUD
grouping, edge-placement and animation regression criteria. Thanks to all
developers and contributors. The explicit mode/element anchor classification,
horizontal-offset rule and draw-only slide behavior are adapted in
`hud_reference_layout.hpp`; Golden Balloon is not a linked runtime dependency.
Its first-party MIT license and the separate provenance of its decomp-derived
`game/` adaptations are documented in `GOLDEN-BALLOON-NOTICE.txt`, included in
both platform packages. Permission was reported by the DKR-R project owner.
No Golden Balloon game assets are redistributed here.

Nintendo, Rare, Diddy Kong Racing and related names and assets belong to their
respective owners. DKR-R includes no game ROM or extracted game assets.
